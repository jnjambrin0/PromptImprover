# Support

This project provides support through GitHub Issues only.

## Where to Ask for Help

Open an issue at:

- [https://github.com/jnjambrin0/PromptImprover/issues](https://github.com/jnjambrin0/PromptImprover/issues)

Use the issue form that best matches your request:

- `Support Question` for usage/help requests
- `Bug Report` for reproducible defects
- `Feature Request` for product improvements
- `Documentation` for docs corrections or gaps

## Information to Include

Provide enough context so maintainers can reproduce or answer efficiently:

- macOS version
- PromptImprover version/build (or commit SHA if building from source)
- Selected tool (`codex` or `claude`)
- What you expected vs what happened
- Steps already tried
- Relevant logs/screenshots (with secrets removed)

## What Is Not a Support Request

- Security vulnerabilities: report privately via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- Feature proposals submitted as bug reports
- Off-topic requests unrelated to this repository

## Response Expectations

Support is provided on a best-effort basis by maintainers and contributors. There is no guaranteed SLA for support issues.

## Self-Service Checklist

Before opening an issue:

1. Read the [README](README.md) and verify installation/runtime prerequisites.
2. Search existing issues for duplicates.
3. Re-test on the latest release (or latest `main`, if relevant).
4. Capture minimal reproduction steps and logs.
