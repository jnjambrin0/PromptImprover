# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors, maintainers, and community members pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Taking responsibility, apologizing to those affected by mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take fair, appropriate corrective action in response to behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Report incidents privately to the maintainer via GitHub profile:

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainer is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers may apply these Community Impact Guidelines when determining consequences:

1. Correction
2. Warning
3. Temporary Ban

Enforcement decisions will be based on the severity, pattern, and impact of behavior.
