# Gemini 3.0 Prompting Guide

## Prompting strategies

The following sections describe a variety of prompting strategies that you can use with Gemini 3 models.

### Lowering response latency

For lower latency responses, try setting the thinking level to  `LOW`  and using system instructions like  `think silently`.

### Distinguishing between deduction and external information

In some cases, providing open-ended system instructions like  `do not infer`  or  `do not guess`  may cause the model to over-index on that instruction and fail to perform basic logic or arithmetic or synthesize information found in different parts of a document.

Rather than a large blanket negative constraint, tell the model explicitly to use the provided additional information or context for deductions and avoid using outside knowledge.

#### Examples

```
What was the profit? Do not infer.

```

This instruction is ineffective because the  `do not infer`  instruction is too broad.

```
You are expected to perform calculations and logical deductions based strictly
on the provided text. Do not introduce external information.

```

Here, the instruction makes it clear that the model should use the provided context for calculations and reasoning.

### Using split-step verification

When the model encounters a topic it does have sufficient information for (such as an obscure place) or is asked to perform an action it does not have capability for (such as accessing a specific live URL), it may generate seemingly plausible but incorrect information in an attempt to satisfy the request.

To avoid this, split the prompt into two steps: first, verify that the information or intended capability exists, then generate the answer based off of that information or capability.

#### Example

```
Verify with high confidence if you're able to access the New York Times home page.
If you cannot verify, state 'No Info' and STOP. If verified, proceed to generate
a response.

Query: Summarize the headlines from The New York Times today.

```

### Organizing important information and constraints

When dealing with sufficiently complex requests, the model may drop negative constraints (specific instructions on what not to do) or formatting or quantitative constraints (instructions like word counts) if they appear too early in the prompt.

To mitigate this, place your core request and most critical restrictions as the final line of your instruction. In particular, negative constraints should be placed at the end of the instruction. A well-structured prompt might look like this:

-   [Context and source material]
-   [Main task instructions]
-   [Negative, formatting, and quantitative constraints]

### Using personas

The model is designed to treat the persona it is assigned seriously and will sometimes ignore instructions in order to maintain adherence to the described persona. When using a persona with your prompts, review the persona that's assigned to the model and avoid ambiguous situations.

#### Example

```
You are a data extractor. You are forbidden from clarifying, explaining, or
expanding terms. Output text exactly as it appears. Do not explain why.

```

### Maintaining grounding

The model may use its own knowledge to answer your prompt, which might conflict with any provided context. While the model is designed to be helpful, if you provide a hypothetical scenario that contradicts real-world facts (prompting with context such as  `Crabs are fictional and have never existed.`), the model may revert to its training data rather than your prompt to align your request with its existing information.

If you need to work in context that isn't grounded in real-world information, explicitly state that the provided context is the only source of truth for the current session.

#### Example

```
You are a strictly grounded assistant limited to the information provided in the
User Context. In your answers, rely **only** on the facts that are directly
mentioned in that context. You must **not** access or utilize your own knowledge
or common sense to answer. Do not assume or infer from the provided facts;
simply report them exactly as they appear. Your answer must be factual and
fully truthful to the provided text, leaving absolutely no room for speculation
or interpretation. Treat the provided context as the absolute limit of truth;
any facts or details that are not directly mentioned in the context must be
considered **completely untruthful** and **completely unsupported**. If the
exact answer is not explicitly written in the context, you must state that the
information is not available.

```

### Synthesizing multiple sources of information

When information is presented in multiple places across a source of context, the model can sometimes stop processing additional information after the first relevant match.

When working with large datasets, like entire books, codebases, or long videos, place your specific instructions or questions at the end of the prompt, after the data context. You can also anchor the model's reasoning to the provided data by starting your question with a phrase like  `Based on the entire document above...`.

#### Example instruction

```
Based on the entire document above, provide a comprehensive answer. Synthesize
all relevant information from the text that pertains to the question's scenario.

```

### Steering output verbosity

By default, Gemini 3 models are less verbose and designed to prioritize providing direct and efficient answers.

If your use case requires a more conversational persona, you must explicitly steer the model to be chattier in the prompt.

#### Example instruction

```
Explain this as a friendly, talkative assistant.

```
